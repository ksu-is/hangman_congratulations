# Hangman_Congratulations 

 

For this project I will be creating the congratulations screen for the hangman game. After the winner wins five straight games in a row the pop-up screen will display a screen with “Congratulations, you won!” along with colorful confetti around and sound so the player can celebrate. The congratulations screen will be made using HTML and CSS. The congratulations page will come after the hangman repository https://github.com/ksu-is/Hangman_Game/blob/master/README.md.
